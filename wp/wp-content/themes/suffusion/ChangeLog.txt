16.	If the drop-down menu was very long, it automatically introduced a scrollbar and some empty space at the bottom. The

21.	Bundled 2 post format icon sets with the theme. These can be used with the post format icon placeholders, which are sprite-enabled. Native integration will
	be provided in the next release.

27. Moved out functions designed for potential BP child themes to a separate file, bp-integration.php

29. Deleted unused method suffusion_comment_pagination.
30. Changed code for printing the title to use wp_title() instead of get_bloginfo(). This is to ensure full compatibility with SEO plugins.

33. Changed default formatting of text to be left/right instead of "justify".
34. Pushed the file inclusion in suffusion-widgets.php to happen upon the "widgets_init" action. This will ensure that the files are included only on screens that need it.
	This speeds up a lot of the loading process.
35. Added option to disable the aspect ratio preservation of images, under Other Graphical Elements -> Miscellaneous.
36. Did major stylesheet cleanup to remove redundant styles. Also optimized the menu CSS

4. Added a new "Query Users Widget" to display site users and/or a user profile.

6. Added support for manual excerpts in pages.
7. Changed code to not store "default" for a post template while saving.
8. Renamed the "Category Posts" widget to "Query Posts". Added capabilities to display recent posts, random posts

11. Removed the use of "jquery-dialog" from the admin panel. The screen-specific help texts have been added via the add_contextual_help function.
	Some admin panel text markup was changed to make it look better in the contextual help screen. This should make the back-end slightly faster.
12. There was a problem with the "No Sidebars" template in IE7, where if there was no widget area below header/above footer, and if
	comments were disabled, the content boxes shrunk to the width of the title.
13. Added a fix for an IE8 bug that doesn't show post thumbnails when floated.
14. Updated translation file.

3. Replaced the JQuery Cycle scripts with the older version - the new one wasn't working in some cases.
4. Replaced output buffering where possible (the_tags, the_category, suffusion_print_author_byline). A couple of uses still remain,
   but those are for cases where there is no "non-echoing" getter.
5. Added classes to the post_class response to show the category id (category-xx-id), sequence number of the post (post-seq-1, post-seq-2 etc)
   and post parity (post-parity-odd, post-parity-even).

5. Fixed a problem with widget styles in the bottom sidebars. They were taking the styles of the top sidebars earlier.
6. Made a couple of corrections to use get_the_title() instead of $post->post_title, to ensure that filters are applied correctly.

16. Added thumbnail support for Category Posts widget.

20. Added rounded corners support for IE9.

27. Fixed a small bug that was showing incorrect default colours in the admin panel for backgrounds, borders and fonts.

31. Removed reference to JQuery Accordion from JQuery UI JS files, since the library was not being used.
